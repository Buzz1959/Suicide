  <center><h4>What Leads to Suicide?</h4></center>
  Suicide can often occurs when environmental stressors and internal mental health issues converge to create an experience for hopelessness and despair. Depression is the most common condition associated with suicide, and often undiagnosed and untreated. Conditions like depression, anxiety and substance problems, especially when unaddressed, increase risk for suicide. Yet it's important ot note that most people who actively manage their mental health conditions go on to engage in life. Most importantly there's no single cause for suicide.  The goal for any individual who is suffering from emotional pain is to receive treatment.
  <center>On average, in New York State, one person dies by suicide every five hours and is the 12th leading cause of death. <a href="https://afsp.org/about-suicide/state-fact-sheets/#New-York"> New York State Suicide Fact Sheet 2019 </a></center>

    <center><h4>Suicide Warning Signs</h4></center> Something to look out for when concerned that a person may be suicidal is a change in behavior or the presence of entirely new behaviors. This is of sharpest concern if the new or changed behavior is related to a painful event, loss, or change. Most people who take their lives exhibior more warning signs, either through what they say or what they do. The more of these signs a person shows, the greater the risk. Warning signs are associated with suicide. It important to remember that these are signs but may not be what actually causes a suicide.
